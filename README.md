Totally FREE for everyone to enjoy your own MacOS, Windows 10 and ubuntu vps.

## Limits:
1. You can run each virtual machine only run up for **6** hours for execution time. If Virtual Machine reaches this limit, it will be terminated and clear everything.
2. Not suggested for you saving some of important and sensitive files to each machine, be risked that all files will be deleted and cannot be undo.
3. Since we are using **ngrok**, you can only run one of those **three** system by one due to ngrok free plan limits, you cannot access both system at the same time unless you purchased **ngrok** pro or business plan.
4. Not suggested to login any account from any website (just like **Google or Microsoft**), since **VNC** connection is not encrypted and easily been accessed other people.

## Suggestions and Best Tricks:
- If you are facing slow and laggy remote control experience from **MacOS** or **Windows**, you can use either **Google Remote Desktop** or **Microsoft Remote Control** for a faster and smoother remotes.
- We highly recommanded you **fork** this project to change username and other displaying names for systems.
